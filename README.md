## **Wrangling Twitter Data**
#### e-Commerce AB Test.ipynb

## **Description**
#### In this project we gather, assess, clean and analyze data from a Twitter user, We Rate Dogs. The data is gathered in three different formats via three different sources: direct download of an archive file in csv format, programmatic download of a tsv file, and a query of Twitters API. The data is assessed visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness, and cleaned with specific uses and analysis in mind. Finally the data is stored into a master dataset and analyzed.
